## stretch ideas

* User
  * can pick a funny quote to display on profile
  * like user description thing
  * sets it to random if not specified
    * will need a quotes table/db to store and update with relevant quotes
    * users should be able to choose a quote from the randomized OR put their own original quote

* Mealsmade
  * "picture" column - string - url of pic
  * add picture of the creation to show off
  * could happen with a "showing off your creation" feature -> make a meal, take a pic, post to instagram/fb/snapchat, pic saves to your meals made wall of fame
  * so save pic to db would need to know how to convert pictures to json? to string? :/
